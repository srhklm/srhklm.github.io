    <h1>My Dearest, Alanna,</h1>
    <p>My thoughts keep drifting back to you. I wanted to write you this letter because there are so many things I need
        to say, and sometimes it's easier to put my feelings into words on paper.

        First, I want to say how incredibly proud I am of you. You're pursuing your dreams at USC, diving headfirst into
        the world of electrical engineering. Your dedication and passion are inspiring, and I know you're going to
        change the world with your brilliance. Every time I think of you, I see your wavy dark hair and that determined
        look in your eyes when you're working on a project. It's a look that says, "I'm going to make this happen," and
        I believe in you more than anything.

        I miss our Alvin and the Chipmunks marathons, the way we would laugh until our sides hurt, and the goofy voices
        we'd imitate. Those were some of the happiest moments of my life, and I cherish them deeply. I miss our
        three-person group chats, the inside jokes, and the way we could communicate without saying a word, just emojis
        and shared memories. Those little moments of connection mean the world to me.

        Do you remember our trips to Canes? The way we'd devour those chicken fingers and toast, laughing about
        everything and nothing. I miss our tennis matches, too, and how we both got obsessed with Challengers after
        watching it. Mike Faist has nothing on our passion for the game! Those afternoons on the court, trying to
        perfect our serves and volleys, are memories I'll hold onto forever.

        Alanna, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time now. I've tried to find the right
        moment, the perfect words, but maybe there never is a perfect time for something like this. The truth is, I'm in
        love with you. Deeply, profoundly, and completely. You are my best friend, my confidante, and the person who
        makes my heart race every time I see you. My feelings for you go beyond friendship, and I've been holding onto
        this for so long, afraid of what it might mean for us.

        But I can't keep it to myself any longer. I love you, Alanna. I love the way you light up when you talk about
        your dreams, the way you care so deeply for those around you, and the way you make me feel like the most special
        person in the world just by being in it. I love every moment we've shared and every moment we have yet to share.

        I understand if you don't feel the same way, and I cherish our friendship more than anything. But I needed you
        to know how I feel. Because you deserve to know that you are loved so completely, so utterly by someone who
        knows you better than anyone else.

        No matter what happens, I'll always be here for you. Our bond is something I treasure more than words can say,
        and nothing will ever change that.</p>
