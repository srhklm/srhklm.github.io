    <h1>My Dearest, Alanna,</h1>
    <p>My Dearest Alanna,

        Upon this parchment I inscribe the yearnings of my heart, hoping that these words might convey the profound
        depth of my affection for thee. As the moon doth gently guide the tides, so too art thou the sovereign of mine
        emotions, guiding me with thy mere presence and the radiance of thy countenance.

        In the hallowed halls of USC, thou dost pursue the noble art of electrical engineering with a fervor and
        brilliance that outshines the very stars. Thy wavy dark hair, a cascade of night, frames a visage of such beauty
        and determination that even the gods might weep with envy. Thy intellect and spirit, unmatched and unyielding,
        inspire a love within me that knows no bounds.

        Oh, how I long for the days of yore, when we delighted in the whimsical antics of Alvin and the Chipmunks. How
        we laughed with abandon, our hearts light and free, our souls intertwined in joyous harmony. The camaraderie of
        our three-person group chats, filled with jest and merriment, remain as treasured as the most precious of gems.
        In those moments, dear Alanna, we found a language of our own, a symphony of shared secrets and silent
        understandings.

        How fondly do I recall our sojourns to Canes, where the simple pleasure of food became a feast of friendship and
        love. The taste of those moments lingers sweet upon my tongue, a testament to the bond we share. Our matches
        upon the tennis court, invigorated by our shared passion for the game and the enchantment of Challengers, where
        Mike Faist's prowess paled in comparison to the delight we found in each other's company.

        Yet, it is with a trembling heart that I pen these next words, for they hold the weight of my soul. Alanna, thou
        art the sun to my firmament, the very breath that gives me life. I am irrevocably, profoundly in love with thee.
        This love, which hath burgeoned in my heart, is a force as old as time, as steadfast as the stars in their
        celestial dance.

        In our friendship, I have found a sanctuary, a refuge from the storms of life. But my heart, bold and daring,
        beseeches thee to know the truth of my affections. I love thee, Alanna, with a passion that transcends the
        bounds of mere friendship. Thy presence ignites a flame within me, a fire that burns with the intensity of a
        thousand suns.

        Shouldst thou not return this love, know that my devotion to our friendship shall remain unwavering. For thou
        art and always shall be, the keeper of my heart.

        With the deepest reverence and love,

        Sarah</p>
